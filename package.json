One is an event system to communicate between scripts without direct reference. \nTwo is a log system that will show logs and popup(if needed) while I'm testing my game on a mobile device where I can't see unity's console and some custom attribute classes. \n\nAlso I will be modifying and adding more tools as I need. \n",
